## Overview
This repository collects high-quality resources for building **agentic** applications using OpenAI’s latest tooling:
- **Agent Builder** for visual workflows
- **Agents SDK** (Python & JS/TS) for code-first agents
- **ChatKit** for embeddable chat UIs
- **Realtime API** for voice and live multimodal agents
- **Durable execution** patterns for production reliability

Each category folder contains a short **README** with curated links. Avoid deep nesting — just one folder level under the root.

## How to Use
1. Browse a category folder below.
2. Open any template link and follow its instructions (they typically run with your `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
3. Prefer **official** docs/examples for core patterns; community templates help you ship faster.

## Categories
- [`Agent-Builder/`](Agent-Builder/) – Visual workflows, how‑tos, and templates.
- [`Agents-SDK-Python/`](Agents-SDK-Python/) – Python agents, tools, sessions, guardrails.
- [`Agents-SDK-JS/`](Agents-SDK-JS/) – JavaScript/TypeScript agents and realtime examples.
- [`ChatKit/`](ChatKit/) – Embeddable chat UI, starter apps, advanced samples.
- [`Realtime-Voice/`](Realtime-Voice/) – Realtime API + telephony integrations.
- [`Durable-Execution/`](Durable-Execution/) – Temporal & production reliability recipes.
- [`Collections/`](Collections/) – Larger curated lists of agents & use cases.
- [`Resources/`](Resources/) – Official docs & learning materials.
- [`Deprecated/`](Deprecated/) – Archived/broken/legacy items.

## Contribute
- Use concise names (max ~60 chars) and **1–2 line** descriptions.
- Keep categories consistent; avoid duplicates.
- Verify links. If broken/unmaintained, move to **Deprecated** with a note.
- Open a PR or issue; see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Changelog
- **2025-10-19** — Full restructure, categories, logo, badges; many new templates and official links added; deprecated items moved to `/Deprecated`.

## Deprecated Templates
See [`Deprecated/`](Deprecated/) for items like **OpenAI Swarm** (replaced by Agents SDK) and other outdated templates.
