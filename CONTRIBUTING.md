# Contributing

Thanks for your interest! This repo aims to provide **runnable, production-minded** templates for OpenAI Agent Builder, Agents SDK, and ChatKit.

## How to contribute
1. **Open an Issue** describing your change or template idea.
2. **Fork** and create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-template
   ```
3. Add docs and runnable examples. Validate that:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` is the only secret required.
   - Code runs locally with minimal steps.
4. Run linters/tests if present, then open a PR with:
   - Clear description, scope, and testing steps.
   - Screenshots or terminal output if helpful.

## Style
- Technical, concise, consistent headings.
- All files in **Markdown**.
- Use placeholders for secrets and IDs (e.g., `WORKFLOW_ID`, `VECTOR_STORE_ID`).
- Include links to official OpenAI docs/blog/GitHub where relevant.

## Code of Conduct
Be respectful and constructive. No sensitive data in PRs or issues.
